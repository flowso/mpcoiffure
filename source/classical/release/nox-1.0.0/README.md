# The Nox Framework

Nox is a simple, lightweight and efficient front-end framework. The point of this framework is to be light weight, beautiful and functional. To achieve this, we don't want to or need to reinvent the wheel, thus, some things are borrowed.

# How to use the files
Using nox is simple. You can read how to do so [at the docs](https://get-nox.com/docs).

# Requirements
Nox has a couple requirements to be able to use it fully. The first requirement is jQuery for most (if not all) of our Javascript. The second is Font Awesome, which is used primarily for the scroll to top feature. They are both bundled by default.

## Github Users
If you are on Github, please note that this repository is not where the main code is stored. It resides on my Gitlab server [here](https://git.assassinskeeper.com/root/NoxFramework).
