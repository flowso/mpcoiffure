# The Nox Framework

Nox is a simple, lightweight and efficient front-end framework. I fully realize that there doesn't need to be yet another framework, but this is a learning experience and a science experiment of sorts. Some things are borrowed, but most everything here is unique to this framework.

# The Docs
There really isn't a complete set of documentation for the framework yet. The framework is very much a work in progress and the releases I've made so far are just to get a baseline when I thought the codebase was good enough.

# How to use the files
Using Nox is simple. You can read how to do so [at the docs](https://get-nox.com/docs).

# Requirements
Nox has a couple requirements to be able to use it fully. The first requirement is jQuery for most (if not all) of our Javascript. The second is Font Awesome, which is used primarily for the scroll to top feature. They are both bundled by default.
